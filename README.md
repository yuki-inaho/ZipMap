## 0. Clarification
This is a **reimplementation** of the code for the paper "ZipMap: Linear-Time Stateful 3D Reconstruction via Test-Time Training".

We have verified that the re-implemented version matches the performance of the original. For any questions or issues, please contact Haian Jin at haianjin0415@gmail.com.

## 1. Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n zipmap python=3.11
conda activate zipmap
pip install -e .
```

## 2. Inference
### 2.1 ZipMap Checkpoints
Download the ZipMap checkpoints hosted on Hugging Face:
| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [**ZipMap**](https://huggingface.co/coast01/ZipMap/resolve/main/checkpoint_aff_inv.pt) | Main model; no reference view specification (stage 3 checkpoint)|
| ***ZipMap Variants*** | |
| [ZipMap w/ reference view](https://huggingface.co/coast01/ZipMap/resolve/main/checkpoint_with_ref_view.pt) | With reference view specification (stage 2 checkpoint) |
| [ZipMap Streaming](https://huggingface.co/coast01/ZipMap/resolve/main/checkpoint_online.pt) | Supports online/streaming inference (fine-tuned from ZipMap) |
| [ZipMap w/ state query](https://huggingface.co/coast01/ZipMap/resolve/main/checkpoint_state_query.pt) | Supports state query (fine-tuned from ZipMap w/ reference view) |

### 2.2 Interactive Gradio Demo
Launch the demo locally for the main ZipMap model:

```bash
python demo_gradio_zipmap.py --ckpt_path /path/to/zipmap_main_checkpoint.pt
```
If using the checkpoint with reference view specification, you disable the affine invariant by setting `--affine_invariant false` when launching the demo.

We also provide scripts to run the demo for the streaming version of ZipMap. 
<details>
<summary>Expand to see:</summary>

The `torch.compile` takes significant time for streaming version of ZipMap. For inference usage, please disable `torch.compile` by setting `TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1` before launching the demo:

```bash
TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1 python demo_gradio_zipmap_streaming.py --ckpt_path /path/to/your/online_checkpoint.pt
```
</details>

### 2.4 Gradio-free sequential RGB CLI and smoke test

For a sorted sequential RGB directory, use the Streaming checkpoint and the
non-interactive CLI. Input names should be zero-padded so that lexicographic
order is temporal order (for example `000000.png`, `000001.png`, ...).

```bash
mkdir -p checkpoints
hf download coast01/ZipMap checkpoint_online.pt --local-dir checkpoints

python scripts/run_zipmap_streaming_sequence.py \
  --input-dir /path/to/sequential_rgb \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/checkpoint_online.pt \
  --output-dir /path/to/output \
  --window-size 1
```

The output directory contains `predictions.npz` with frame names, W2C poses,
intrinsics, depth, and depth confidence, plus a compact `summary.json`.

The repository includes a GPU smoke test. It extracts two consecutive frames
from `examples/videos/drift-straight.mp4`, runs the CLI, and validates finite
pose and depth outputs. The default test suite excludes GPU tests; run the
model smoke test explicitly:

```bash
pytest
TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1 pytest -m gpu -q
```

### 2.3 Quantitative Evaluation
See branch `evaluation` for code and instructions on how to run the quantitative evaluation and runtime measurements. Our evaluation code is heavily built on top of [this repository](https://github.com/ZhouTimeMachine/recons_eval) provided by the authors of [Pi3](https://github.com/yyfz/Pi3). We sincerely thank the authors for their open-source contributions.

## 3. Training
We train our model with FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) using GPUs with 80GB memory. If you have access to such hardware, you can run the training with the provided configs. If not, you can modify the configs to fit your hardware (e.g., by reducing batch size and using more aggressive FSDP sharding strategies).

### 3.1 Preparation
<details>
<summary><strong>Setup WandB for Logging</strong></summary>

Before training, fill in your WandB API key in `training/config/wandb_key.yaml` (get yours at [wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize)):

```yaml
wandb: YOUR_WANDB_API_KEY_HERE
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Download the Pretrained VGGT Checkpoint</strong></summary>

Download the VGGT checkpoint:

```bash
mkdir -p checkpoints
wget -O checkpoints/vggt_checkpoint.pt https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/resolve/main/model.pt
```

</details>

### 3.2 Debug Run
Before running the full training, we recommend doing a quick debug run to ensure everything is set up correctly. This run only uses two datasets.

<details>
<summary><strong>First download the two datasets for the debug run</strong></summary>

**1. Prepare VKITTI dataset**
- a. Use `training/data/datasets/preprocess/download_vkitti.sh` to download the VKITTI dataset. (This script is from VGGT's repository)
- b. Use our script `training/data/datasets/preprocess/save_vkitti_metadata.py` to save the metadata to improve IO efficiency.

**2. Prepare MVS-Synth dataset**
- a. First download the [MVS-Synth dataset](https://phuang17.github.io/DeepMVS/mvs-synth.html). Choose the 720p version.
- b. Then, preprocess the MVS-Synth dataset by running the script `training/data/datasets/preprocess/preprocess_mvs_synth.py` to convert data format. (This script is from CUT3R's repository)
- c. Run our script `training/data/datasets/preprocess/save_mvs_synth_metadata.py` to save the metadata to improve IO efficiency.

</details>

After that, you can use the `default_debug` config for this purpose:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_debug base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data
```

**The first few iterations may be slow due to torch.compile for TTT modules.** After that, the per-iteration time should be a few seconds. 

### 3.3 Full Run
The full training uses 29 datasets, including 23 static datasets and 6 dynamic datasets. Please prepare the datasets following the instructions in [training/data/README.md](training/data/README.md). After that, you can run the full training with the following commands:

```bash
# Stage 1: Train on 23 static datasets.
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_stage1_hi_res_static base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data

# Stage 2: Train on all 29 datasets (23 static + 6 dynamic datasets).
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_stage2_hi_res_dynamic base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data checkpoint.resume_checkpoint_path=/path/to/your/stage1_checkpoint.ckpt

# Stage 3: Remove the reference view specification and keep tuning on all 29 datasets.
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_stage3_hi_res_dynamic_aff_inv base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data checkpoint.resume_checkpoint_path=/path/to/your/stage2_checkpoint.ckpt
```

### 3.4 Fine-tuning

#### 3.4.1 ZipMap State Query
We train a ZipMap-State-Query model by finetuning the ZipMap checkpoint with reference view specification (stage 2 checkpoint)
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand to see run commands:</strong></summary>

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_finetune_state_query base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data checkpoint.resume_checkpoint_path=/path/to/your/stage2_checkpoint.ckpt
```
</details>

#### 3.4.2 ZipMap Streaming

We train a ZipMap-Streaming model by finetuning the offline ZipMap checkpoint (stage 3). We replace the transformer-based camera head with a lightweight MLP-based camera head, keep the rest of the model unchanged, and fine-tune on all 29 datasets.
<details>
<summary><strong>Expand to see run commands:</strong></summary>

```bash
# Stage 1: Train on 12-view context length for 60k iterations.
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_finetune_online_run1 base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data checkpoint.resume_checkpoint_path=/path/to/your/offline_stage3_checkpoint.ckpt

# Stage 2: Continue training on 24-view context length for 30k iterations.
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 training/launch.py --config default_finetune_online_run2 base_data_dir=/path/to/your/data checkpoint.resume_checkpoint_path=/path/to/your/previous_online_run_checkpoint.ckpt

# We have seen obvious improvements after extending the training context length from 12 to 24. Due to time constraints, we only train the model on 24-view context length. If you have more time and resources, I recommend continuing to train the model on a longer context length (e.g., 48 or 64 views) for further performance improvement.

```
</details>


> **Note:** Due to time constraints, we did not fully explore the streaming setting and only ran a last-shot experiment. With more careful tuning and longer training, the streaming model's performance can likely be further improved.

<details>
<summary><strong>Potential directions to explore:</strong></summary>

- Replace the current `TTT with Muon` with `TTT with momentum`, which is much more efficient for streaming-version training.
- Fine-tune from the stage 2 checkpoint (with reference view specification) instead of the stage 3 checkpoint, which may improve training stability and potentially improve final performance.
- Instead of directly replacing the camera head with a lightweight MLP-based head, re-use the transformer-based camera head and only replace its bidirectional self-attention with causal attention.
- Train on a longer context length (e.g., 48 or 64 views).
